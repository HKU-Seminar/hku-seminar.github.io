# Abstract
We consider a model of renegotiation in extensive-form games:  when it is playeri’s turn to move,ican “renegotiate” the equilibrium by suggesting new strategies for all players for the remainder of thegame. This renegotiation is successful if it improvesi’s utility, and cannot itself be renegotiated at a laterround in the game.  Although not all finite games haverenegotiation-safestrategies, natural classes ofgames do.We argue that renegotiation-safety captures rationality in the context of cryptographic protocols in amore meaningful way than traditional solution concepts. We also present protocols for the task of secretsharing that are renegotiation-safe assuming the existence of two non-negotiating players; additionally,we show that such protocols require the existence of at least one non-negotiating player.
