# Abstract
> Online social networks (OSNs) allow users to jointly compute on each other’s data (e.g., proﬁles, geo-locations, etc.). Privacy issues naturally arise in this setting due to the sensitive nature of the exchanged information. The paper *Server-Aided Secure Computation with Off-line Parties*  introduce an interestring mechanism to support secure computation over OSN with some nice properties, such as efﬁciency, friend non-participation and data re-usability. This talk will briefly introduce the concept of Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption. Then the paper and its basic idea will be introduced.
