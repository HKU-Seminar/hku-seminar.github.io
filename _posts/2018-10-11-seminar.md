# Abstract
> In daily life, people are accustomed to expressing their attitudes or experiences via online evaluation system. These systems mainly provide a platform to collect evaluations, such as for courses, movies, shopping experiences. Nevertheless, it seems that traditional approaches which offer Client/Server (C/S) structure solutions cause many privacy and fairness concerns. For example, evaluators' privacy and evaluation results are under the control of system administrator. In this thesis, a decentralized solution is proposed to overcome the defect of the traditional evaluation systems using the blockchain technique and the linkable ring signature scheme. For better illustration, an implementation of the proposed solution for evaluating teaching quality is given in this thesis, together with the security analysis.
