# Abstract
> This talk will include the basic introduction of zero knowledge and sigma protocol. Some background knowledge and example of zero knowledge will be given. The construction of sigma protocol is also included in this talk.

Materials are collected from Bingsheng Zhang's slides, Qi Wang's slides and Yehuda Lindell's slides.
